WADDUP BIG PIMPS (and you Ilya)

This is where we will add our code, github becomes easy to use quite quickly, don't worry!

You can edit 'branches' on here penis directly, or to avoid conflict (if someone else is working on the same bit of code) you can create a new branch and merge them later, deciding which parts of the new and origninal branches to keep, and which bits to delete.

changing things is fun.

Edit things in your preffered python editor, then add the changes to the relevent files here!
