This is where we will add our code, github becomes easy to use quite quickly, don't worry!

You can edit 'branches' on here directly, or to avoid conflict (if someone else is working on the same bit of code) you can create a new branch and merge them later, deciding which parts of the new and origninal branches to keep, and which bits to delete.
